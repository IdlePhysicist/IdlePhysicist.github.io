      <title>Navigation by paper &gt;&gt; Navigation by app</title>

      <description>FOREWORD: I should point out here that Google / Apple / Bing Maps, (insert mapping service here), can under favourable circumstances navigate one to their destination with limited fuss. But in my situation this was not the case.
Potentially this could be caused by my smartphone, or it might be my carrier, or the mapping / navigation app, or a combination of the above.
I’ve always favoured a paper map and real directions, this has made me somewhat of an outlier with my cohort of friends and generation as a whole.</description>

      <description>The internet as we know it was developed at CERN in 1990, credit going to Tim Berners-Lee. The frist browser was developed by the same man at CERN on a NeXT cube, this was great if you had a NeXT machine but they were costly so other browsers such The Line Mode browser filled the gap. In 2019 a group of developers and designers gathered at CERN to rebuild the experience of the WorldWideWeb broswer on a NeXT machine within a tab of a modern browser.</description>

      <title>Night to Day: Twilight</title>

      <description>I have always been intriuged by the speed at which day turns to night, and the change in the length of the day over the course of the year. It is often said that Irish people are obsessed with the weather and as such the length of the day too. As we would say:
 There&amp;rsquo;s a grand stretch in the evenings
 We are at least partially vindicated in our obsession because if one has never experienced standing outside at 10 PM on a summer night in what feels like early evening light, then that person can never understand the strange feeling it brings.</description>

      <title>Self-hosting Gitea on Amazon Lightsail</title>

      <description>I recently took the decision to try my hand at self hosting a Git. I had a few reasons for this:
 I just wanted to do it, to go through the process of setting up and running a webserver and database. I personally don’t like the new GitHub UI changes. That topic is a can of worms so briefly. I am very fond of the old design and it’s layout.</description>

      <title>Homebrew Formula for Therion</title>
      <link>https://eoghan.speleo.dev/posts/2020/homebrew-therion.html</link>

      <guid>https://eoghan.speleo.dev/posts/2020/homebrew-therion.html</guid>
      <description>I had used a Homebrew formula to install Therion in the past, but at some point I migrated to building it from source. I very rarely used Therion for anything other than messing around because I did not have the opportunities to do much surveying and when I did I was not in charge of handling the data. I mainly built Therion from source to challenge myself.
Recently a fellow caver emailed me wondering if I had had success installing Therion with that same Homebrew formula, so I ran down the issues he was seeing.</description>

      <description>Sigh this one was a real piece of work. So as you may know I document my caving adventures in a log (see below), each month has a log entry. Until recently I used the app Ulysses to export my logs using a template I got from their website. When I upgraded my MacBook to an SSD, I looked for something new, since I don&amp;rsquo;t quite agree with the subscription model that they have adopted.</description>

      <title>Mounting Macintosh Drives</title>

      <description>So this March I decided it was time to give my MacBook Pro a new lease of life. It still had its original 500GB HDD that it had come with. I had not updated my version of OS X since Yosemite in 2015, and that is because I used Apple&amp;rsquo;s Aperture for processing my photographs and Yosemite was the last version of OS X to support Aperture. This of course had the knock on effect of making it harder and harder to use Homebrew as time wore on.</description>

      <title>Why do I descend faster the further I get down a pitch?</title>
      <link>https://eoghan.speleo.dev/posts/2019/descend-faster.html</link>

      <guid>https://eoghan.speleo.dev/posts/2019/descend-faster.html</guid>
      <description>Something I have often noticed while descending pitches in caves is that the further down the pitch/rope I get the faster I am travelling. So I set about using some of my kinematics knowledge to analyse the system and see what is going on.
 Simple, with diagram showing friction points where the rope is in contact with the Simple &amp;amp; braking carabiner
  Firstly I wrote out some potential reasons for this observation.</description>

      <title>Cloghleagh Mine, 1862-1868</title>

      <description>I am a believer in “giving it a go”, at least once anyway. So without a cave to survey we found the next best thing. I had known of the Cloghleagh Mine for several years now, but have never really had the chance to explore it. So a few weekends ago, myself and Erin decided to head up and have a look in, we armed ourselves with two helmets, two iPhone compasses, and a 10’ measuring tape.</description>

      <title>The Nokia 3310 3G</title>
      <link>https://eoghan.speleo.dev/posts/2018/nokia-3310.html</link>

      <description>The Nokia 3310 has been a staple of internet culture for many years now, predominantly due to the robustness of the handset and longevity of the battery. The renowned 3310 was killed off by Nokia in 2006 in a changing market, after selling 126 million units.
  The original 3310
  To put this in perspective Apple announced the first iPhone in January 2007. In the time from the first iPhone launch to March 2017, Apple released 16 separate devices under the iPhone name (up to the 7 &amp;amp; 7+), totalling 1.</description>

      <title>Plotting in Julia (using Python)</title>
      <link>https://eoghan.speleo.dev/posts/2018/julia-plotting.html</link>

      <guid>https://eoghan.speleo.dev/posts/2018/julia-plotting.html</guid>
      <description>The first step is to have Julia installed as well as a plotting library. I chose to use PyPlot as it uses Matplotlib which I am used to from Python. Install PyPlot using Pkg.add(&amp;quot;PyPlot&amp;quot;) at the Julia prompt.
Below is an example to generate a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram.
# Reading in some data. data = readdlm(&amp;#34;stars.txt&amp;#34;,&amp;#39; &amp;#39;) temperature = data[:,1] magnitude = data[:,2] # Call the plotting library as below using PyPlot figure(1,figsize=(6,6)) rc(&amp;#34;font&amp;#34;, family=&amp;#34;sans&amp;#34;) rc(&amp;#34;xtick&amp;#34;, labelsize=&amp;#34;small&amp;#34;) rc(&amp;#34;ytick&amp;#34;, labelsize=&amp;#34;small&amp;#34;) scatter(temperature,magnitude,linewidth=2) #ylim(0,0.</description>

      <title>Compile Scripts</title>
      <link>https://eoghan.speleo.dev/posts/2018/compile-script.html</link>

      <guid>https://eoghan.speleo.dev/posts/2018/compile-script.html</guid>
      <description>A compile script is a shell script to compile programs which consist of multiple files, and potentially libraries too. In my opinion at least a compile script is a step below a Makefile. I had honestly not heard of such a thing until I was helping a lecturer to test that his old FORTRAN simulation would compile and run on a modern UNIX machine. The purpose of the script was to simply compile all the source files and then link the object files to the executable1.</description>

      <title>The Sea Interferometer at Dover Heights, NSW</title>
      <link>https://eoghan.speleo.dev/posts/2018/sea-interferometer.html</link>

      <description>Dover Heights was a Second World War RADAR station, taken over by the CSIRO Dept. of Radiophysics after war. CSIRO then repurposed the station for solar observations as well as observations of the first &amp;ldquo;radio stars&amp;rdquo;. For the first 4 years of operation, the station used arrays of Yagi antennae, with ever increasing numbers of elements. 1950 saw the arrival of the first dish antenna, a 4.9m parabolic dish mounted to the roof of the WWII block house.</description>

      <title>What the hell is with Simultaneous Equations?</title>
      <link>https://eoghan.speleo.dev/posts/2017/what-the-hell-is-with-simultaneous-equations.html</link>

      <guid>https://eoghan.speleo.dev/posts/2017/what-the-hell-is-with-simultaneous-equations.html</guid>
      <description>NB: In school when we say Simultaneous Equations, we generally mean to say a system of linear equations or a linear system.
Well it&amp;rsquo;s a fair question! They were always one thing I struggled with in school, but I could usually wrangle the answers for the 2 dimensional set of equations but I could never get the correct answers for a 3 dimensional set of equations. We probably all learnt the same method for solving Simultaneous Equations, or symbos as one teacher in my school referred to them as.</description>

      <title>Les Paul Jimmy Page Wiring</title>

      <description>In 2012 I got a Les Paul Studio 50s Tribute, which was a very nice guitar to begin with. In 2016 I bought a Jimmy Page wiring kit on eBay. I altered the wiring from the schematic included with the kit to one with the 1950s wiring style (see below for more information). The first time I tried to wire it up I make a dog&amp;rsquo;s dinner of it, and the guitar didn&amp;rsquo;t work.</description>

      <description>In 2011, I got a EMG HZ pre-wired scratchplate. It had two passive EMG humbuckers and a master volume &amp;amp; tone. Over time I removed the neck pickup, partially due to lack of use, partially to resemble this guitar.
Phil X&amp;rsquo;s ESP Viper
Now (May 2017) that I have become more savvy with a soldering iron, I have rewired the system, retaining only the EMG HZ bridge pickup, and the three way selector switch.</description>

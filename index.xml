      <description>I am a recently graduated Astrophysicist from DCU, and I currently earn my living as a Software Engineer. But whenever I get the chance I am a tinkerer, a caver, a photographer, and explorer.
Since 2014 I have been a member of DCU Caving Club and the Speleological Union of Ireland (SUI), and have had an extremely interesting time and thrilling adventures with the club, and the friends I made in it.</description>

Background I used to keep track of what caves I have visited (and who I go with) using an Excel Workbook. I decided (in 2017) to write a program to do this for me because why not ?!
Come 2019, I started to use Go at work, and I finally go around to looking at this project again.
 A screen shot of cave-logger
  Functionality The app is fairly basic, it gives the user the ability to create, update and delete entries for trips, cavers, and caves.</description>

      <description>go-latex Repo
I had an idea to use some Unicode characters in my Go projects, particularly ones that are physics or calculation based projects. But I personally did not want to have to either copy and paste the unicode characters or have to manually type in the unicodes for the various characters.
So I devised a solution, which was to write a simple parser that would regex out LaTeX commands for Greek letters and insert the correct character from a map stored within the application binary.</description>

      <description>Sigh this one was a real piece of work. So as you may know I document my caving adventures in a log, each month has a log entry. Until recently I used the app Ulysses to export my logs using a template I got from their website. When I upgraded my MacBook to an SSD, I looked for something new, since I don&amp;rsquo;t quite agree with the subscription model that they have adopted.</description>

      <description>So this March I decided it was time to give my MacBook Pro a new lease of life. It still had its original 500GB HDD that it had come with. I had not updated my version of OS X since Yosemite in 2015, and that is because I used Apple&amp;rsquo;s Aperture for processing my photographs and Yosemite was the last version of OS X to support Aperture. This of course had the knock on effect of making it harder and harder to use HomeBrew as time wore on.</description>

      <description>PDF Split Repo
I saw someone painstakingly exporting pages of a large PDF document manually to get smaller individual PDFs, containing ranges of pages from the parent document. I thought &amp;ldquo;Hey I could definitely make that easier!&amp;quot;, so I sat down for a couple of hours and wrote a very short script to act as a middleman between the user and GhostScript.</description>

Caution This is another quickly thrown together project that may have unintended results, and a perhaps more reliable program could be put together in Python in half the lines &amp;amp; a quarter the time. But it was to be a learning experience!
In work a couple of weeks ago I came upon a task that I thought could be made easier by having a JSON file to parse instead of a csv file, and I had a hankering to write some Go after been stuck on Python projects for months.</description>

      <title>#10 - Why do I descend faster the further I get down a pitch?</title>

      <guid>https://eoghan.speleo.dev/posts/2019-03-02-descend-faster/</guid>
      <description>Something I have often noticed while descending pitches in caves is that the further down the pitch/rope I get the faster I am travelling. So I set about using some of my kinematics knowledge to analyse the system and see what is going on.
  Simple, with diagram showing friction points where the rope is in contact with the Simple &amp;amp; braking carabiner
  Firstly I wrote out some potential reasons for this observation.</description>

I wanted to keep track of my fuel consumption so I wrote a little app to do it. It&amp;rsquo;s my first GUI application, using PyQt5. I store the data in a SQLite database.
Note there are three branches of the code, this is only a prototype there will be bugs &amp;amp; the numbers may be invalid!

      <description>I am a believer in âgiving it a goâ, at least once anyway. So without a cave to survey we found the next best thing. I had known of the Cloghleagh Mine for several years now, but have never really had the chance to explore it. So a few weekends ago, myself and Erin decided to head up and have a look in, we armed ourselves with two helmets, two iPhone compasses, and a 10â measuring tape.</description>

      <description>The Nokia 3310 has been a staple of internet culture for many years now, predominantly due to the robustness of the handset and longevity of the battery. The renowned 3310 was killed off by Nokia in 2006 in a changing market, after selling 126 million units.
To put this in perspective Apple announced the first iPhone in January 2007. In the time from the first iPhone launch to March 2017, Apple released 16 separate devices under the iPhone name (up to the 7 &amp;amp; 7+), totalling 1.</description>

      <guid>https://eoghan.speleo.dev/posts/2018-08-12-julia-plotting/</guid>
      <description>The first step is to have Julia installed as well as a plotting library. I chose to use PyPlot as it uses Matplotlib which I am used to from Python. Install PyPlot using Pkg.add(&amp;quot;PyPlot&amp;quot;) at the Julia prompt.
Below is an example to generate a HertzsprungâRussell diagram.
# Reading in some data. data = readdlm(&amp;#34;stars.txt&amp;#34;,&amp;#39; &amp;#39;) temperature = data[:,1] magnitude = data[:,2] # Call the plotting library as below using PyPlot figure(1,figsize=(6,6)) rc(&amp;#34;font&amp;#34;, family=&amp;#34;sans&amp;#34;) rc(&amp;#34;xtick&amp;#34;, labelsize=&amp;#34;small&amp;#34;) rc(&amp;#34;ytick&amp;#34;, labelsize=&amp;#34;small&amp;#34;) scatter(temperature,magnitude,linewidth=2) #ylim(0,0.</description>

      <guid>https://eoghan.speleo.dev/posts/2018-05-27-compile-script/</guid>
      <description>A compile script is a shell script to compile programs which consist of multiple files, and potentially libraries too. In my opinion at least a compile script is a step below a Makefile. I had honestly not heard of such a thing until I was helping a lecturer to test that his old FORTRAN simulation would compile and run on a modern UNIX machine. The purpose of the script was to simply compile all the source files and then link the object files to the executable1.</description>

      <description>Dover Heights was a Second World War RADAR station, taken over by the CSIRO Dept. of Radiophysics after war. CSIRO then repurposed the station for solar observations as well as observations of the first &amp;ldquo;radio stars&amp;rdquo;. For the first 4 years of operation, the station used arrays of Yagi antennae, with ever increasing numbers of elements. 1950 saw the arrival of the first dish antenna, a 4.9m parabolic dish mounted to the roof of the WWII block house.</description>

      <description>NB: In school when we say Simultaneous Equations, we generally mean to say a system of linear equations or a linear system.
Well it&amp;rsquo;s a fair question! They were always one thing I struggled with in school, but I could usually wrangle the answers for the 2 dimensional set of equations but I could never get the correct answers for a 3 dimensional set of equations. We probably all learnt the same method for solving Simultaneous Equations, or symbos as one teacher in my school referred to them as.</description>

      <description>In 2012 I got a Les Paul Studio 50s Tribute, which was a very nice guitar to begin with. In 2016 I bought a Jimmy Page wiring kit on eBay. I altered the wiring from the schematic included with the kit to one with the 1950s wiring style (see below for more information). The first time I tried to wire it up I make a dog&amp;rsquo;s dinner of it, and the guitar didn&amp;rsquo;t work.</description>

      <description>In 2011, I got a EMG HZ pre-wired scratchplate. It had two passive EMG humbuckers and a master volume &amp;amp; tone. Over time I removed the neck pickup, partially due to lack of use, partially to resemble Phil X&amp;rsquo;s ESP Viper.
Now (May 2017) that I have become more savvy with a soldering iron, I have rewired the system, retaining only the EMG HZ bridge pickup, and the three way selector switch.</description>

      <description>Coffee Socket is an idea I had a number of years ago, when I was frequenting coffee shops in Dublin and inevitably needed to charge my laptop. The concept was for a website (initially) that would have an embedded map with pins for each coffee shop / tea room in Dublin. &amp;ldquo;Nothing interesting here&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;re thinking to yourself, well the cool bit was that by clicking on each pin you would be told the number of seats &amp;amp; power sockets per floor, as well as the ratio of seats to sockets.</description>

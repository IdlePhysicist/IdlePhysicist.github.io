      <description>In 2012 I got a Les Paul Studio 50s Tribute, which was a very nice guitar to begin with. In 2016 I bought a Jimmy Page wiring kit on eBay. I altered the wiring from the schematic included with the kit to one with the 1950s wiring style (see below for more information). The first time I tried to wire it up I make a dog&amp;rsquo;s dinner of it, and the guitar didn&amp;rsquo;t work.</description>

      <description>In 2011, I got a EMG HZ pre-wired scratchplate. It had two passive EMG humbuckers and a master volume &amp;amp; tone. Over time I removed the neck pickup, partially due to lack of use, partially to resemble this guitar.

Now (May 2017) that I have become more savvy with a soldering iron, I have rewired the system, retaining only the EMG HZ bridge pickup, and the three way selector switch.</description>

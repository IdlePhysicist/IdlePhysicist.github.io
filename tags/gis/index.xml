      <description>Coffee Socket is an idea I had a number of years ago, when I was frequenting coffee shops in Dublin and inevitably needed to charge my laptop. The concept was for a website (initially) that would have an embedded map with pins for each coffee shop / tea room in Dublin. &amp;ldquo;Nothing interesting here&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;re thinking to yourself, well the cool bit was that by clicking on each pin you would be told the number of seats &amp;amp; power sockets per floor, as well as the ratio of seats to sockets.</description>

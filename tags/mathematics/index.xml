      <description>NB: In school when we say Simultaneous Equations, we generally mean to say a system of linear equations or a linear system.
Well it&amp;rsquo;s a fair question! They were always one thing I struggled with in school, but I could usually wrangle the answers for the 2 dimensional set of equations but I could never get the correct answers for a 3 dimensional set of equations. We probably all learnt the same method for solving Simultaneous Equations, or symbos as one teacher in my school referred to them as.</description>
